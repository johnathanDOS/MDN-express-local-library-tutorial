# MDN Express Local Library Tutorial
A model of a Local Library application developed to learn fundamentals of Express.js through tutorial at MDN.

Through this project I learned how to use the Express.js framework to build an application that can:
- Create and store data in MongoDB document models
- Route GET requests and send representations to the client data using .pug templates
- Handle POST requests to create, update, and delete documents in the databse
- Deploy an application to a cloud server such as Heroku
