In building this project I learned how to build an application using the Express framework that can:
- Create and store data in MongoDB document models
- Route GET requests and send representations to the client data using pug templates
- Handle POST requests to create, update, and delete documents in the databse
- Deploy an application to a cloud server such as Heroku
